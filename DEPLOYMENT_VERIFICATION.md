# Deployment Verification Guide

This document provides instructions for verifying that your FridgeToPlate web application has been successfully deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Verification Steps

1. **Check GitHub Pages Activation**
   - After pushing your repository to GitHub and configuring GitHub Pages in the repository settings
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for the initial deployment to complete
   - GitHub will show a green checkmark and a "Your site is published at" message with the URL

2. **Access the Deployed Application**
   - Visit your GitHub Pages URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/fridgetoplate/`
   - Verify that the homepage loads correctly with all styles and images

3. **Test Core Functionality**
   - Test image upload functionality
   - Verify ingredient recognition works
   - Check that recipe suggestions appear
   - Test fusion recipe generation

4. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Verify the application works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Test on both desktop and mobile devices

5. **Performance Check**
   - Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools to check performance
   - Aim for scores above 80 in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 404 Errors
- Ensure your repository is public
- Check that GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from the correct branch
- Verify the repository name matches the URL path

### Missing Assets
- Check that all paths in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are relative
- Ensure all required files were included in the repository

### Routing Issues
- For client-side routing, ensure you're using hash-based routing or have configured a 404.html redirect
- Test navigation between different pages

### API Functionality
- Since this is a static deployment, API routes won't function
- Verify that mock data is being used for demonstration purposes

## Permanent URL

Once verified, your application will be permanently available at:
`https://yourusername.github.io/fridgetoplate/`

You can share this URL with others to access your application from any device with a web browser.
